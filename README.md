## Prepare vocab embedding

To generate vocab embedding and word list(include entity, pos... label), run:

```
python train.py  prepare_vocab.py
```
Generate vocab.pkl and  embedding.npy file

## Training 

To train a graph convolutional neural network (CA-WGCN) model, run:

```
python train.py
```
Model checkpoints and logs will be saved to `./saved_models/00`.

Next training  automatic
Model checkpoints and logs will be saved to `./saved_models/01`.

For details on the use of other parameters, such as the pruning distance k, please refer to `train.py`.

 ## Evaluation

To run evaluation on the test set, run:

```
python eval.py saved_models/00 --dataset test
```
This will use the `best_model.pt` file by default. Use `--model checkpoint_epoch_10.pt` to specify a model checkpoint file.

## Retrain

Reload a pretrained model and finetune it, run:

```
python train.py --load --model_file saved_models/01/best_model.pt --optim sgd --lr 0.001
```
